Windows specific issues
==================================

Requirements
-------------
Thonny is supported on Windows 7 and later.

Starting with version 1.0 Thonny comes with an embedded Python, so you don't need to install Python separately.


Installing
-----------------
The installing and uninstalling procedures are really standard, nothing much to say about this.

The slightly unusual thing with Windows installer is that it doesn't request admin privileges to run. This way students can install it on their lab computers at school without bugging the administrator. Without admin privileges it's not possible to install under Program Files, that's why installer proposes a folder under current user's home folder. (BTW, Microsoft now recommends per user installs, look for "*The recommended default installation context is per-user*" in http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa367559%28v=vs.85%29.aspx)
