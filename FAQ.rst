I want to help by translating Thonny UI or webpage to another language. How should I start?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We're grateful for everybody who have offered translations, but at the moment Thonny doesn't have any infrastructure set up for this. We haven't considered it a priority because Thonny users need to deal with English anyway (because of Python keywords and libraries). Most likely Thonny's UI remains English-only.

On the other hand, we're glad to add links for tutorials/help/documentation written in other languages.
