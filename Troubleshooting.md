## Won't start and no error messages ##

If Thonny doesn't open and you don't see any error messages, then you have two options for going further -- either run it from terminal and observe the messages printed there, or check the logs.

### Open in Terminal (macOS) ###

First open the Terminal (under Utilities).

If you copied Thonny to your desktop then enter following command:

```
~/Desktop/Thonny.app/Contents/MacOS/thonny
```
If it is under Applications, then use following command instead:

```
/Applications/Thonny.app/Contents/MacOS/thonny
```
