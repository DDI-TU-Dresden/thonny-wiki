Theming
=======

Since version 2.2 Thonny supports UI themes, which allow changing the appearance of widgets, and Syntax themes, which allow specifying coloring scheme for editors and the shell. A couple of themes are built into Thonny, but users can add their own themes via the `plug-in system <Plugins>`_.
