Building Pygame
===============


Mac OS X
----------
Copied from http://pygame.org/wiki/MacCompile

Install the SDL libraries from dmg (http://www.libsdl.org/)

* SDL  1.2.15
* SDL_mixer 1.2.12
* SDL_ttf  2.0.11
* SDL_image 1.2.12

2. Install the libjpeg and libpng libraries from dmg (http://ethan.tira-thompson.com/Mac_OS_X_Ports.html)

4. Installed Xcode 4.4 from Apple apps. Need to add command line tools.
To do this start Xcode and go to Preferences under Xcode menu. Choose the Download tab and select Components.
Then install the Command Line Tools.

5. Installed XQuartz. Mountain Lion OS X no longer includes the X11 window system library.
This is different from Lion OS X (http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/)

6. Downloaded pygame tar file from 
http://pygame.org/download.shtml

pygame-1.9.1release.tar.gz 

Decompressed and extracted to create directory pygame1.9.1release

6. Before compilation of pygame:

SDL_x header files refer to SDL as <SDL/SDL_yy.h> However, a SDL directory is not under
the include directory of SDL (SDL/Headers). To fix this in a simple way: Went to directory ``/Library/Frameworks/SDL.framework/Headers`` then made a link as follows ``ln -s SDL ./`` (Didn't work for me, made dir and copied).

7. Changed to the pygame directory (normally pygame1.9.1release). Then switched to the super user.
However, you can use the sudo command instead. I set the following compilation flags

export CC='/usr/bin/gcc'
export CFLAGS='-isysroot /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.11.sdk -I/opt/X11/include -arch i386'

You must specify using the original location of X11. The mac does not have a ld.so.conf
and apparently the links generated by XQuartz in /usr do not work correctly.

8. Now execute:   

* ``python config.py`` This should find the SDL, jpeg, png, and numpy libraries.
* ``python setup.py build``This will build in the directory before installing. It should complete with no errors.
* ``python setup.py install``
