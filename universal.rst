Universal install
=================

If for some reason you can't run Thonny bundled with Python, then you can install it to an existing Python 3.4 or 3.5 distribution, which has Tkinter and IDLE installed. Just do something like:

.. sourcecode:: none

    pip3.5 install thonny

For runnning do:

.. sourcecode:: none

    python3.5 -m thonny

(Your system may have other commands instead of ``pip3.5`` and ``python3.5``.)
